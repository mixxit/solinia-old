<h1>How to resuscitate a dead friend</h1>
<p>
In Ryzom players who loose all of their hit points fall into a coma.
When they are in a coma their hit point bar starts to fill up with a
deep red color. When the bar is completely full they die and must
choose a bind point and re-spawn. Comatose players can be resuscitated.
Dead players cannot.<br>
One resuscitates players by casting heal spells on their comatose
corpses.
Each heal spell makes the deep red bar recede. Casting sufficient heal
spells to completely eliminate the dark red brings the comatose player
back to life.
