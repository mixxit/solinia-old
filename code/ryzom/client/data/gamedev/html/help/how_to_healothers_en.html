<h1>How to heal others</h1>
<p>
In order to heal other players you will need a heal spell (not a "self" power).
If you had taken at least a magician pack 2 during the character creation, you should have one,
else, you will need to learn one from the magic trainer.<br>
You need to target the player you wish to heal and click on the healing spell icon in the Hands Bar.<br>
If the action does not appear in your hands bar, drop it from your progression window.
or create it by right clicking on a free slot of the hands bar.
Note that if you only have a 'self' power, you will not be able to heal other players.
